# Cycle 34 - timed-out



KILLED. This cycle was still running after 45 minutes, so it
was stopped, along with every process it had started (6 in
total). The relay did NOT wait for it and has carried on to the next item.

Anything it had already written to disk is still there - a kill does not undo
work - so read the evidence below before assuming this item is untouched.



Started 2026-08-27 05:47:51, took about 45 minutes.

How it ended: killed at the 45 minute deadline.



Evidence checked: git refs on every branch, the working tree, and these

files named in the brief: bidlow/relay/QUEUE.md



## What it was asked to do



# Cycle 34 - queue item 23

This brief was written by the relay itself, off the top of QUEUE.md. Greg has
not read it. If it is wrong, say so in your log rather than working around it,
and correct QUEUE.md.

## The item, verbatim from the queue

> **BY 31 AUG (NOT tomorrow) — RELATED-DOMAIN DETECTION IS WEAKER THAN PROMISED.** The email says near-certain matches are blocked AUTOMATICALLY and weaker ones flagged for the team. What exists proposes everything and blocks nothing. It also says the strongest signal is companies sharing a MICROSOFT TENANT, which we can verify directly — that signal is NOT implemented; we used DMARC/SPF instead. Assess honestly: is tenant matching feasible against Graph, and can a near-certain match auto-block safely? If auto-blocking is still the wrong call after measuring, say so plainly with evidence so Greg can correct the client rather than quietly under-deliver.

## The one rule

THE HARD RULE, and it is not negotiable:
Real email may be sent, and data deleted, ONLY for the `bidlowai` client.
Every other client may be built on, tested and measured. Nothing leaves the
building for them. This is enforced in `autonomous-actor-guard.ts`, not by
your good intentions. If a task seems to need a real send for anyone else,
that task is wrong - stop and write down why.

## Before you touch anything, write these four things down

1. **The files you are going to change.** Name them. If you cannot yet, your
   first job is to find out, and that reconnaissance IS the cycle.
2. **The red-first test.** Name the test file and what it asserts. Watch it FAIL
   before you make it pass. If the behaviour cannot go red first, say why, and
   prove the test is capable of failing by deliberately breaking the code and
   showing the red - that is this repository's established substitute.
3. **What "done" looks like** for this item, in one sentence a non-coder can check.
4. **What you must NOT touch.** Anything outside the files in (1).

## The rules that apply to every cycle

* Do not stall on a question. Decide, record the decision and why, and continue.
  If the decision is genuinely Greg's - money, a client relationship, an
  irreversible one-way door - stop and write down the question instead.
* Gates before you claim anything: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm test`. Show the real output. A gate you did not run is not met.
* Commit and push when confident. Branch protection is ON, so it is
  branch -> PR -> green CI -> merge. Never push straight to `main`.
* If you deploy, verify the running commit by HASH against the DIRECT App
  Service URL (`app-opensdoors-outreach-prod.azurewebsites.net`), never the
  CDN-cached custom domain, and never liveness alone.
* Production migrations are real. `PRODUCTION_PRISMA_MIGRATE` is true, so
  merging a migration applies it to the live client database.
* When you finish, update this item's row in `.bidlow/relay/QUEUE.md` to
  `DONE 34`, or back to `TODO` with a note if you could not do it.
* Do NOT write the next NEXT.md. The watcher does that. One cycle, one item.

## Assume the seventh exists

QUEUE.md records six instances this week of something built, wired, reporting
success, and never firing. It is the defect this project is worst at by a wide
margin. Whatever you build this cycle, prove it FIRES - not that it exists.
